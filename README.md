See Your Future
===============

A gen AI project for GAIT ECE:5995 Fall25

Motivation and Background
-------------------------

People enjoy interactive self-reflection tools that blend personalization, creativity, and entertainment. Many existing apps generate single shot “future you” portraits or personality blurbs, but they rarely go deeper or adapt to the user’s responses. 

See Your Future is a web-based experience that uses generative AI to build a richer, multi-round “future snapshot.” The app first asks baseline questions, then uses AI to generate a short set of personalized follow-up questions. Based on all responses plus an optional selfie and resume, the system produces: 
    * A written future narrative 
    * A 0 –100 “future quality” score 
    * An AI-generated image illustrating that future 
    * An audio narration of the future 
    * A set of habit-change suggestions and an “improved future” with new narrative, score, and image 

The tool is explicitly framed as entertainment and self-reflection, not prediction.
